# TOKEEB

Old telephone keyboards have a letter layout over the numeric 12 keys.

For access the letter must press it 1 or 2 or 3 times. 
Like 8(t)44(h)-1-444(i)7777(s)

```
    1 record on/off
    2 abc
    3 def
    4 ghi
    5 jkl
    6 mno
    7 pqrs
    8 tuv
    9 wxyz
    0 space
    * 1a?
    # shift on/off
```

What could be a better layout ? Using the frequency of letters on NGLS
and minimize finger movement for most used words.

0   for space and backspace
\*   for 12 selects as letters, symbols, functions, etc
\#   for 12 controls and alone to ends key repeats

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 for arranje multiples signs

## Restrictions

Assign keys in order frequency list. Use NGSL.
No digraph in same key, possible 27 * 27 = 729, real   
No trigraph in same key, 
Balance counts to minimize overuse,
